How to Complete the Waiter Minigame in Dahngrest's Tavern

Out of pure frustration with this minigame and wasting a few pages of paper trying to write all the orders down, I created this application to complete this minigame to keep my sanity. The following guide will assume you are using this application. There are similar applications online, but this one is likely the best ui and is mobile friendly.

## Application to complete this minigame easier and faster than any other method

In this minigame, you have to take orders from the customers in the tavern. After you take an order, you can go back to the bar to report the order and receive the menu items. Then you can return these menu items to the customers.

This minigame becomes incredibly time consuming and can cause massive headaches. For sure one of my least favorite minigames.

Most will tell you the best strategy is to use pen and paper to collect everyone's orders, but here I will introduce you to a much easier and much faster way to handle this task.

Here is an application I created:

[https://vesperia-waiter.web.app/](https://vesperia-waiter.web.app/)

The application is desktop, tablet, and mobile friendly. Requires no download or personal information.


## How to complete this minigame

Once a customer has a speak bubble over their head, move to that customer and talk to them. They will start listing off menu items and the quantity of that item they want.

On the application, select that menu item. Then follow up by selecting the quantity they mention. You will notice that at the top of the application, a list of menu items and quantity will generate. This will be what you submit to the bar after you finish taking the order from the customer. You may notice that the list generated might not be in the order you are reporting. This is because the generated list is in the order of the bar's menu. This will speed up reporting the order to the bar.


Sometimes the customer will say "Forget that last one..." This means that you need to discard the last menu item they listed from their order.

To handle this, click the "Forget that last one..." button. The generated list of menu items at the top of the application is automatically remove this item.


Once the customer completes their order. Walk back to the bar and talk to the character you talked to to start this minigame. You will see a menu of items to pick from with a number on the right side. Reference the generated list at the top of the application to assign the quantity of each menu item in the order.

Once you complete reporting the order, you will need to walk back to the customer you talked to and deliver the order. At this point, you can click the 'CLEAR' button to empty the generated list at the top of the application.

Repeat until you've served all the customers.


As you unlock characters for this minigame, the game will get harder by adding more items to the menu and increasing the maximum quantity that a customer will ask for. They will also more likely say 'Forget that last one...'

As this happens, click the gear icon in the upper right corner of the application. You will see a small list of settings pop up from the top. Here you can expand your list of menu items to match up with the current character you're playing as for this minigame.

You can also increase the maximum number of quantities for orders by adjusting the slider to the right or left. The max number is 50, but personally I didn't need more than 30.


## Tips
Try not to forget to CLEAR after each customer's order. If you don't, you'll mix up two orders and likely have to start over.

Even though the customers look more and more frustrated waiting for their order, you can take all the time in the world to complete a level. I'd suggest you keep a calm mind, go slow, and make sure you record the orders correctly.

You can also talk to multiple customers before going to the bar, but I'd highly recommend you focus on one customer at a time. Also, the application was built around handling one customer at a time.

## Rewards
You are rewarded a small sum of Gald for completing each level.

The primary reward is if you complete it with all the available characters, you'll unlock their titles related to this minigame.
